Welcome!
My name is Jess and I am pursuing my Master of Science in Geographic Information Science at Clark University. I hold a Bachelor of Arts from Clark in Environmental Science with a Mathematics minor.

My interests lie in the fields of land change modeling and human-environment interactions. My experience runs the gamut from hydrology to ichthyology to cryology.

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, rollerblading, hiking, and spending time with my dog, Mj.
